# Calculus-python

In this post's chapter, we will discuss basic calculus lessons on differentiation and integration, along with examples of their coding applications in Python. Towards the end, there is also an additional bonus lesson that combines statistical analysis with data visualization. This way, with just one coding session, you will obtain both the actual values and their visual representation.

Happy lesson!!!
